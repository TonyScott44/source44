#SQL Practice + Notes <br>
<br>
Tools Utilized: MySQL Community Server, MySQL Workbench <br>
<br>
Notes on MySQL Workbench's Interface <br>
<br>
Setup New Connection <br>
Connection Method: Standard (TCP/IP) is the default method<br>
Hostname: 127.0.0.1 is the address of the local machine <br>
Port: 3306 is the default port for the MySQL server<br>
Username: root is the username for admin
Password: this pw was set during MySQL installation
<br>
Administration tab <br>
Used to do administrative work such as starting/stopping a server, importing/exporting data, etc.<br>
<br>
Schemas tab <br>
Shows the available databases in the current database server.<br>
<br>
Tables: Where we store data <br>
<br>
Views: Virtaul tables (can combine data from multiple tables and put them in a view) that are <br>
used to make reports. <br>
<br>
Stored Procedures & Functions: Little programs that we store inside of our DB for querying data.<br>
Ex. procedue for getting all the customers in a given city, so we call that procedure to get all<br>
the customers in San Francisco, and this will return all the customers in San Francisco.
<br>
Every column in a table represents a DB field (ex. customer_id). <br>
Every row in the table is referred to as a record. <br>
